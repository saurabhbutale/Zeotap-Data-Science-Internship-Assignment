### Assignment Tasks

#### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset.
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA.
   - Write these insights in short point-wise sentences (maximum 100 words per insight).

#### Task 2: Lookalike Model
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends **3 similar customers** based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:
- Use both customer and product information.
- Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.

#### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information (from `Customers.csv`) and transaction information (from `Transactions.csv`).
- You have the flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters between **2 and 10**.
- Calculate clustering metrics, including the **Davies-Bouldin Index** (DB Index) as it will be used for evaluation.
- Visualize your clusters using relevant plots.
